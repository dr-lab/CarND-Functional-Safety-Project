# CarND-Functional-Safety-P3
Udacity Self-Driving Car Nanodegree - Functional Safety Project

# Project overview

This project's goal is to learn how to create the documentation for the functional safety of a Lane Assistance system to comply with the [Road vehicles - Functional safety : ISO 26262](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_26262). ISO 26262 is an international standard for functional safety on electrical and/or electronic system in production automobiles defined by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO). The Lane Assistance system is part of a [Advanced Driver Assistance System(ADAS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_driver-assistance_systems) with the following functionalities:

- Lane departure warning: To apply an oscillating steering torque to provide the driver a haptic feedback.
- Lane keeping assistance: To apply the steering torque when active in order to stay in ego lane.

# Scope of the Project

For the lane assistance project, the following safety lifecycle phases are in scope:

      Concept phase
      Product Development at the System Level
      Product Development at the Software Level

The following phases are out of scope:

      Product Development at the Hardware Level
      Production and Operation


Udacity provides a seed project with document templates, architectural diagrams and guidance on how to approach the project. Here is the link to that [seed project](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-Functional-Safety-Project)

The documentation consists on the following documents

- [Safety Plan](./01_SafetyPlan_LaneAssistance.pdf)
- [Hazard Analysis and Risk Assessment](./02_HazardAnalysisAndRiskAssessment.pdf)
- [Functional Safety Concept](./03_FunctionalSafetyConcept_LaneAssistance.pdf)
- [Technical Safety Concept](./04_TechnicalSafetyConcept_LaneAssistance.pdf)
- [Software Requirements And Architecture](./05_SoftwareRequirementsAndArchitecture_LaneAssistance.pdf)

**Note:**
Since the [Hazard Analysis and Risk Assessment](./02_HazardAnalysisAndRiskAssessment.pdf) original Number(Apple iWork) file has a very wide table, when export to pdf, table been divided into two pages. So when you check the pdf, for the second part of the columns ("Hazardous Event Classification" and "Determination of ASIL and Safety Goals"), please check the second page.
